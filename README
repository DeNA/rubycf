Ruby extension for dealing with CoreFoundation types.  Mostly designed for reading/writing binary and xml plists.

See RubyCF::PList for available methods.

== Examples
See the unit tests for examples.

== About CFData
Since Ruby doesn't treat strings any differently from raw data and CoreFoundation does, there needed to be a way to specify if a string is a string or if it's just data.  For this purpose, I've created the class RubyCF::Data, which is just a container for a ruby string.  When a RubyCF::Data object is passed into the plist encoder, it will encode the data as CFData.  Likewise, when a CFData object is encountered while decoding a plist, a RubyCF::Data object will be created.

== About CFLite
To get this to work outside of the OS X, you need to compile lib/CoreFoundation and link against it when building the gem.  This is build into extconf.rb, but you may need to modify it if it can't find the path to your library.

See the following for information on building CFLite under Linux.
